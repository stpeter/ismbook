<h2>humanism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[From Latin humanus: relating to or characteristic of human beings.]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(ethics) Any school of thought that focuses primarily on human concerns as opposed to the interests of the gods (<a href="theism.html">theism</a>) or the technical issues of philosophy (<a href="logicism.html">logicism</a>). Examples include <a href="aristotelianism.html">Aristotelianism</a> and <a href="epicureanism.html">Epicureanism</a> in ancient Greece, <a href="confucianism.html">Confucianism</a> and <a href="taoism.html">Taoism</a> in China, Renaissance humanism in Europe, and some forms of <a href="transcendentalism.html">transcendentalism</a> and <a href="pragmatism.html">pragmatism</a> in America. Although humanism is often closely associated with <a href="secularism.html">secularism</a> and <a href="individualism.html">individualism</a>, these connections are not necessary; in fact, humanism is sometimes thought of as a religion of humanity that takes <a href="altruism.html">altruism</a> and action for the sake of all humanity as its guiding principle (as in the <a href="positivism.html">positivism</a> of August Comte).</p></li></ol>
