<blockquote>
<p><em>[A privative term derived from Greek theos: god.]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(metaphysics) Atheism is an active disbelief in the existence of gods, deities, and supernatural powers; in this respect it is similar to <a href="secularism.html">secularism</a> and opposed to any variety of <a href="theism.html">theism</a>. Atheism is to be contrasted with <a href="agnosticism.html">agnosticism</a>, which takes a skeptical attitude toward the existence of gods but does not proclaim disbelief. Although atheistic doctrines are most notorious in their more militant (really anti-theistic) forms, other philosophies instead take the existence or role of gods to be irrelevant in human life and ethics and thus could be termed nontheistic (examples include <a href="epicureanism.html">Epicureanism</a> and the Samkhya school of <a href="hinduism.html">Hinduism</a>). Popularly, atheism is often taken to imply a lack of any ideals or values whatsoever (nearly equivalent to <a href="immoralism.html">immoralism</a>), but this connotation rests on an assumption that religion is the only foundation for values (thus ignoring the possibility of ethical <a href="naturalism.html">naturalism</a>).</p></li></ol>
