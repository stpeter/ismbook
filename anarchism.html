<h2>anarchism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[A privative term derived from Greek archos: leader or ruler.]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(politics) Anarchism is inspired by the moral-political ideal of a society untouched by relations of power and domination among human beings. This ideal has most often expressed itself in a doctrine advocating the total absence of government as the only firm basis for individual liberty and societal progress - a doctrine that some argue animates even <a href="marxism.html">Marxism</a> (since Marx believed that eventually the state would wither away). Anarchism differs from political <a href="libertarianism.html">libertarianism</a> in advocating a lack of government rather than limited government. There are several variants of anarchism, usually categorized by whether the variant is collectivistic (e.g., anarcho-syndicalism) or individualistic (e.g., anarcho-capitalism) in orientation. In popular usage, the term is often colored by the sometimes-violent anarchist political movement that was especially active in the years around 1900.</p></li></ol>
