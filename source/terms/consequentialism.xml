<term id='consequentialism' name='consequentialism'>
  <source>From English consequential: following something else, especially as an effect or result; derived from Latin consequi: to follow closely.</source>
  <def topic='ethics'>The view that ethical decisions are best or properly made on the basis of the expected outcome or consequences of the action. Both &pragmatism; and &utilitarianism; are forms of consequentialism. Because consequentialism tends to focus on the impact of an action on persons other than the actor, in general it is a variety of &altruism; rather than &egoism;.</def>
