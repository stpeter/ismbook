<term id='communalism' name='communalism'>
  <source>From French and Latin communal: of a commune or community.</source>
  <def topic='politics'>Communalism is a kind of small-scale &utopianism; or voluntary &collectivism;. Political communalists sometimes posit that local communities should have virtual autonomy within the context of a larger state or society (similar to Robert Nozick's concept of meta-utopia). Nonpolitical communalists simply build intentional communities.</def>
