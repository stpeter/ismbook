  <source>From the name of the Greek philosopher Pyrrho (c. 360-270 BCE).</source>
  <def topic='epistemology'>Pyrrho was a painter and poet who accompanied Alexander the Great on his Asian campaign and apparently underwent a philosophical conversion in Gandhara on the northwestern fringes of India, fueling speculation that he was influenced by early &buddhism;. He believed that tranquility could be achieved only by steadfastly withholding judgment about ethical matters because they cannot be reliably decided as good or evil, true or false.</def>
