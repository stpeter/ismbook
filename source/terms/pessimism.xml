  <def topic='metaphysics'>Specifically, the view of Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) that reality and human nature are essentially malevolent. More generally, the view (opposed to &optimism;) that knowledge and happiness are ultimately unattainable; degrees of pessimism range from mild (e.g., &stoicism; and, on some interpretations, &buddhism;) to severe (e.g., &fatalism;).</def>
