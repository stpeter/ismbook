<term id='deconstructionism' name='deconstructionism'>
  <source>A term coined by the French critic Jacques Derrida (1930-2004).</source>
  <def topic='aesthetics'>A late 20th-century theory of literature that concentrates on finding "ruptures" or inconsistencies in a text, thus enabling the critic to break down or "deconstruct" it. Such deconstruction consists of asserting a personally or communally relative interpretation (usually focused on power relations or class conflict in society) without claiming that any text or interpretation has objective truth or meaning. Deconstructionism is a specific kind of &postmodernism;, and leans heavily toward &subjectivism; or even &nihilism;.</def>
