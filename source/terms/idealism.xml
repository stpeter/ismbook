<term id='idealism' name='idealism'>
  <source>From Greek idea: archetype, pattern, form, type.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>In the original, Platonic sense, a theory claiming that the primary reality consists of eternal, unchanging, non-physical archetypes, of which the particular entities perceived by the senses are imperfect copies. The most significant forms of idealism after &platonism; are the monadology of Leibniz (a kind of &panpsychism;) and &hegelianism;. Although &spiritualism; is similar to idealism, it usually refers more to religious, supernatural conceptions of reality than to philosophical theories. The opposite of metaphysical idealism is &materialism;.</def>
  <def topic='epistemology'>Any theory holding that valid human knowledge is a matter of mentally grasping non-physical archetypes rather than perceiving (or abstracting concepts from) physical entities. Theories opposed to epistemological idealism include &empiricism; and &conceptualism;.</def>
