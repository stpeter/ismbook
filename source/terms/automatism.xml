<term id='automatism' name='automatism'>
  <source>From Greek automatismos: that which happens on its own.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>The doctrine that the actions of animals are mechanistically determined. In particular, this doctrine is one constituent of &cartesianism;, since Descartes (1596-1650) advocated a strict &determinism; or &mechanism; in biology. Although automatism has little basis in biological fact, its core beliefs have persisted into recent times under different names (e.g., see &behaviorism;).</def>
