  <def topic='ethics'>The view that the proper beneficiary of a person's actions is the self, not others as in &altruism;. Essentially, another word for &individualism;. The term egoism is used more frequently in philosophy than the term egotism, which in common usage implies an utter disregard for other people (whereas a broad notion of egoism could include regard for friends, family, etc.).</def>
