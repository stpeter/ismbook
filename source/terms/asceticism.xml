<term id='asceticism' name='asceticism'>
  <source>From Greek asketes: a hermit or monk; derived from askesis: practice, training, mode of life.</source>
  <def topic='ethics'>Originally, an ascetic was one who practiced the mode of life of a hermit or  monk, characterized by solitude, meditation, prayer, toil, fasting, and celibacy. Implicit in this lifestyle of self-discipline and self-denial is the idea that the pleasures of this world should be renounced in favor of a higher purpose such as intellectual discipline or mystical insight. Often asceticism is connected to either &spiritualism; or &rationalism;. For the opposite view, see &sensualism;.</def>
