<term id='kantianism' name='Kantianism'>
  <source>From the name of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724&#8211;1804).</source>
  <def topic='ethics'>Although Immanuel Kant is known for &transcendentalism; or &idealism; in metaphysics and a subtle &constructivism; in epistemology, his signature idea was &deontologism; in ethics. In particular, Kant's fundamental contribution to ethical thought was the 'categorical imperative', according to which the only actions we can legitimately call moral are those that are done purely for the sake of a universal moral law, not from any personal interest (not even an interest in acting in the best way possible!).</def>
