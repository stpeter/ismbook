<term id='henotheism' name='henotheism'>
  <source>From Greek henos and theos: one god.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>Belief in a particular god without denying the existence of other gods. Henotheism is often considered to be a transitional belief between &polytheism; and &monotheism;, since monotheists think that henotheism's tolerance of more than one god is primitive and misguided.</def>
