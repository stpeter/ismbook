  <source>From Greek deontos: that which is binding, right, proper.</source>
  <def topic='ethics'>Any theory emphasizing universal imperatives such moral laws, duties, obligations, prohibitions, or imperatives (thus sometimes also called imperativism). &kantianism; is the prime example of a deontological theory. Deontologism is usually contrasted with &teleologism; (an emphasis on goals) and &consequentialism; (an emphasis on results), but sometimes is also contrasted with &egoism; and &eudaimonism; (an emphasis on personal happiness or fulfillment as opposed to conformance with moral imperatives). In practice, deontologism is often closely allied with ethical &intuitionism;.</def>
