  <source>From Greek hedone: pleasure.</source>
  <def topic='ethics'>The principle that the fundamental standard of ethical judgment should be pleasure. Although the term has connotations of &sensualism; and &emotionalism;, philosophical hedonists (such as those in the tradition of &epicureanism;) advocate an enlightened hedonism that is often a kind of &naturalism;. Although hedonism is usually a species of &individualism;, &utilitarianism; advocates "the greatest pleasure for the greatest number" and thus could be construed as a kind of universalized hedonism.</def>
