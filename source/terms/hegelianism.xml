<term id='hegelianism' name='Hegelianism'>
  <source>From the name of the German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel (1770-1831).</source>
  <def topic='system'>The philosophical system of Hegel or the philosophical tradition that began with him. In metaphysics, Hegel advocated a kind of historically-minded absolute &idealism;, in which the universe would realize its spiritual potential through the development of human society. Hegel's absolute idealism is often contrasted with the subjective or transcendental &idealism; of &kantianism;, on whose innovations - in addition to the metaphysical &absolutism; of Spinoza (1632-1677) - Hegel based much of his philosophy. In political theory, Hegel advocated an organic theory of the state positing that individuals are merely parts of the whole (a form of &collectivism; often also attributed to &platonism;). Hegel was probably the first philosopher to think of history as a dialectical process, which inspired the &dialecticalmaterialism; of &marxism;.</def>
