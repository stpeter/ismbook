  <source>From Sanskrit budh: to awaken or to know.</source>
  <def topic='religion'>In ancient India, a buddha was a person who had achieved deep or even divine enlightenment. The historical Buddha of Buddhist thought was Siddhartha Gautama (5th or 6th century BCE), who lived a life of detachment from worldly affairs, distrust of perceptual appearance and social conventions, inner-directed reflection and meditation, and suppression of pain, sorrow, and desire. Traditionally, Buddhism has stressed self-denial (similar to &stoicism; but sometimes bordering on &asceticism;), the unity of all things (see &holism;), and a kind of spiritualized &individualism;. Although many Buddhists consider Gautama to be divine, Buddhism is not a form of &theism; in the Western sense. Through the centuries, several major schools of Buddhist thought emerged (most prominently Mahayana and Theravada) and Buddhist ideas were combined with traditional Chinese beliefs like &taoism;, resulting in Ch'an (or Zen) Buddhism. In fact, Buddhism is quite similar to Taoism in many ways, although Buddhism is closer to &transcendentalism; since it puts a greater value on ultimate detachment and eternal enlightenment, a state known as nirvana. Early Buddhism probably also influenced ancient Greek &skepticism; since the founder of &pyrrhonism; was converted to philosophy in Gandhara on the northwestern fringes of India.</def>
