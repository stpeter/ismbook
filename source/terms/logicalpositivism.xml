  <def topic='epistemology'>A movement of 20th-century epistemology that developed as a reaction against 19th-century &idealism; by combining &logicism; and &empiricism;. The logical positivists tended to argue that only carefully-constructed propositions (preferably formulated in terms of symbolic logic) about strictly-limited factual domains could be true or false, and that any less precise proposition or more wide-ranging theory was metaphysical &transcendentalism; or sentimental &emotionalism;. In addition to their somewhat hardline epistemological doctrine, the logical positivists tended to ignore the value-branches of philosophy or even to espouse &emotivism;.</def>
