<term id='nihilism' name='nihilism'>
  <source>From Latin nihil: nothing, non-existence.</source>
  <def topic='ethics'>Traditionally, a rejection of common morality or religion. For example, Nietzsche (1844-1900) is often said to have been a nihilist because of his opposition to Christianity as well as his &perspectivism;. More recently, some nihilistic currents of 20th-century thought (e.g., some strains of &existentialism;) bordered on a kind of activist &irrationalism; by celebrating the meaninglessness of existence and even wanton destruction for its own sake.</def>
