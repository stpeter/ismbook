<term id='behaviorism' name='behaviorism'>
  <source>From English behavior: the manner in which a person, animal, or thing acts, either characteristically or in particular circumstances.</source>
  <def topic='psychology'>The doctrine that only a person's or animal's externally observed ways of acting provide legitimate data for the study of psychology. As originally formulated by John D. Watson in 1913, behaviorism was a methodological principle defined in order to pursue scientific objectivity in psychology. However, the behaviorist movement (pushed forward by prominent psychologists such as B.F. Skinner and influenced by scientific &operationalism;) soon came to dismiss any internal states, mental phenomena, or higher-order emergent properties of living beings. The result was a kind of &reductionism;, &materialism;, or even &automatism; applied to animal and human activity, which in its more radical forms did not even seek to reduce consciousness to stimulus-response interactions, but simply ignored mental phenomena altogether. From the 1960s onwards, behaviorism was supplanted by psychological &cognitivism; and more recently by evolutionary psychology.</def>
