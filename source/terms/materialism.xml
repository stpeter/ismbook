<term id='materialism' name='materialism'>
  <source>From Latin materialis: relating to matter.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>The view that fundamentally only matter exists. Materialism is opposed to &idealism; and considers any talk of the soul to be a throwback to the bad old days of &spiritualism; and &vitalism;. Because materialists generally assert that matter can be known completely in terms of physical laws (see &reductionism;), they often lend theoretical support to &determinism;.</def>
