<term id='egalitarianism' name='egalitarianism'>
  <source>From French egalite: equality.</source>
  <def topic='politics'>The view that equality is the most important societal (and even ethical) value. Egalitarians usually focus on equality of results, rather than equality of opportunity or equality before the law, which are ideas usually associated with classical &liberalism; or &libertarianism;. In practice, egalitarian policies usually focus on the equal distribution of wealth, sometimes verging on &socialism;.</def>
