<term id='epicureanism' name='Epicureanism'>
  <source>From the name of the Greek philosopher Epicurus (341-270 BCE).</source>
  <def topic='ethics'>A school and theory of ethics that advocated enlightened &hedonism;. Epicurus held that true pleasure consists in the absence of all bodily pains and mental disturbances, a condition he claimed could be easily achieved through moderation, friendship, and the pursuit of wisdom. While Epicureanism was more individualistic than the competing school of &stoicism;, its view of happiness was less activist than that of &aristotelianism; and can even be compared to some Eastern views like &taoism;. Epicurus founded his school in an Athenian garden in the generation after the death of Aristotle and it flourished throughout the Mediterranean for over 700 years.</def>
