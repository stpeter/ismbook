<term id='communitarianism' name='communitarianism'>
  <source>From Latin communitas: community or fellowship.</source>
  <def topic='politics'>In the nineteenth century, the word "communitarian" was used to refer to members of voluntary communities formed to put socialist or communist ideas into practice (close to the more recent usage of the term &communalism;). After the fall of the Iron Curtain (and the demise of true &socialism;), a movement of intellectuals resuscitated the term to describe a philosophical and political challenge to the seeming triumph of market &liberalism;, stressing the importance of fellowship and community over economic relations and market interactions.</def>
