<term id='communitarianism' name='communitarianism'>
  <source>From Latin communitas: community or fellowship.</source>
  <def topic='politics'>In the 19th century, the word "communitarian" referred to members of voluntary communities formed to put socialist or communist ideas into practice (close to the more recent usage of the term &communalism;). In the 1990s, a movement of intellectuals resuscitated the term to mount a philosophical and political challenge to the seeming triumph of market &liberalism;, stressing the importance of fellowship and community over economic relations and market interactions.</def>
