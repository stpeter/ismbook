  <source>From Greek pan: all and Greek psuche: soul.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>The idea (similar to &animism;, &pantheism;, and &organicism;) that a world soul is present in everything that exists. The monadology of Leibniz (1646-1716) is one form of panpsychism, since it holds that all physical things consist of little bundles of consciousness he called monads.</def>
