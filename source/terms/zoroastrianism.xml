<term id='zoroastrianism' name='Zoroastrianism'>
  <source>From the name of the Persian sage Zarathustra (6th or 7th century BCE).</source>
  <def topic='religion'>Perhaps the first example of &monotheism; among the religions of the world, Zoroastrianism held that there is a neverending struggle between good or truth and evil or deceit (a kind of &dualism; that influenced both &gnosticism; and &manicheism;), that human beings have free will to choose between good and evil, and that individuals are subject to a final judgment assigning them to eternal salvation or damnation. Scholars speculate that the monotheism and messianism of Zoroastrianism had an influence on Middle Eastern religions such as &judaism;, &christianity;, and &islam;, that early &buddhism; was a reaction against the dogmatic ethical and religious certainties of Zarathustra, and that the very word philosophy is derived from Mazdayasna or "worship of wisdom" (the Avestan name for Zoroastrianism).</def>
