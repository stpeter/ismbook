<term id='pragmatism' name='pragmatism'>
  <source>From Greek pragmatikos: having to do with action, practical affairs, or matters of fact.</source>
  <def topic='epistemology'>The view, originated by C.S. Peirce (1839&ndash;1914) and made famous by William James (1842&ndash;1910) and James Dewey (1859&ndash;1952), that the truth of a concept is to be evaluated by its practical consequences for human affairs.</def>
  <def topic='ethics'>A form of &consequentialism; that differs from &utilitarianism; by emphasizing practical action instead of usefulness to others. While pragmatism is thus a kind of &humanism;, it rejects &naturalism; and often tends to be a kind of &relativism;.</def>
