<term id='marxism' name='Marxism'>
  <source>From the name of the German philosopher Karl Marx (1818&#8211;1883).</source>
  <def topic='politics'>A theory of economics and society asserting that social and political change is determined by control over the means of economic production. Marxism inherited its dialectical understanding of history from &hegelianism;, but opposed Hegel's &idealism; with a supposedly-scientific &dialecticalmaterialism;. Although many Marxists claim that in theory their philosophy is a form of &humanism;, in practice Marxist political systems such as Leninism and Maoism have proved to be forms of &collectivism; and therefore quite the opposite of humanism. (To be fair, in reaction to some of his early followers Marx said that he was not a Marxist.)</def>
