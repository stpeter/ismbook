  <source>From Italian fasci: groups (of men), in which the Italian Fascist movement began.</source>
  <def topic='politics'>A form of nationalistic &authoritarianism; that originated in Italy and spread throughout other parts of Europe (especially Germany and Spain) and the world. Although fascism was ostensibly opposed to &communism; because it allowed private property (albeit under tight government control), it did not differ in essentials from other forms of &collectivism; in the 20th century (in fact fascism was a form of national socialism, in contrast to the international socialism of &communism;).</def>
