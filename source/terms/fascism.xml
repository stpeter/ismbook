  <source>From Italian fasci: groups (of men), in which the Italian Fascist movement began.</source>
  <def topic='politics'>A theory and practice of extreme nationalism that developed originally in Italy and spread throughout other parts of the world. Although fascism was ostensibly opposed to &communism; because it allowed private property (albeit under tight government control), it did not differ in essentials from other forms of 20th-century &collectivism;, &authoritarianism;, or &totalitarianism;.</def>
