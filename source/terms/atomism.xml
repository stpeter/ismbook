  <source>From Greek atomos: indivisible.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>Any metaphysical or cosmological idea that reality is fundamentally made up only of extremely small, indivisible particles. This view was widespread among ancient Greek philosophers such as Democritus (460?-362? BCE) and Epicurus (341-271 BCE), and was revived in the 17th century by philosophers such as the Pierre Gassendi and scientists such as Robert Boyle, the founder of modern chemistry.</def>
