  <source>From Greek atomos: indivisible.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>Any metaphysical or cosmological idea that reality is fundamentally made up only of extremely small, indivisible particles. This view was widespread among ancient Greek philosophers such as Democritus (460?-362? BCE) as well as in the school of &epicureanism;, and was revived in modern times by scientists and philosophers such as the 17th-century Epicurean Pierre Gassendi.</def>
