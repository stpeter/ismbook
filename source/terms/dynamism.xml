<term id='dynamism' name='dynamism'>
  <source>From Greek dynamis: power, force, energy.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>The idea that the universe fundamentally consists of changeable forces or energies rather than stable, divisible entities. Dynamism is often augmented by the notion that much of the stability we perceive is illusory and that everything is constantly changing or in flux (sometimes called a Heraclitean view of the universe, after the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus). The most famous dynamists of recent times were Alfred North Whitehead and Henri Bergson, who are sometimes called "process philosophers" because they focused on processes rather than entities.</def>
