<term id='communism' name='communism'>
  <source>From Latin communis: shared by all.</source>
  <def topic='politics'>The political theory that the individual's actions should benefit the community or the state rather than the individual himself. It is the most radical kind of political &collectivism;, and depends on an equally radical collectivism or &altruism; in ethics. In practice, communism has always been a form of &authoritarianism; or &totalitarianism;. When referring to actual political systems, communism is sometimes called Marxism-Leninism because of communism's link with the revolutionary doctrines of &marxism; and with countries inspired by the example of Lenin's revolution in Russia (and Mao's revolution in China).</def>
