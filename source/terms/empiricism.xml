  <source>From Greek empeirikos: relating to or derived from experience.</source>
  <def topic='epistemology'>A theory of knowledge holding that experience is the most reliable source of knowledge. In general, empiricism emphasizes induction over deduction and reality over theory - as, for instance, in the essays of Francis Bacon (1561-1626). More specifically, the school of empiricism in the 17th and 18th centuries reacted against the excesses of medieval &scholasticism; and &rationalism; by formulating a more systematic grounding for empirical knowledge. The founder of that school was John Locke (1632-1704), whose epistemology tended towards &representationalism; rather than &realism;, leading eventually to the &skepticism; of David Hume (1711-1776). By empiricism is sometimes meant more narrowly a focus on scientific experiment; however, a more appropriate term for that view is &scientism; or &experimentalism;.</def>
