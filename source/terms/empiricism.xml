<term id='empiricism' name='empiricism'>
  <source>From Greek empeirikos: relating to or derived from experience.</source>
  <def topic='epistemology'>A theory of knowledge holding that experience is the most reliable source of knowledge. In general, empiricism emphasizes induction over deduction and reality over theory (as, for instance, in the essays of 16th century philosopher Francis Bacon). More specifically, the school of empiricism in the 17th and 18th centuries reacted against the excesses of medieval &scholasticism; and &rationalism; by formulating a more systematic grounding for empirical knowledge. The founder of that school was John Locke (1632&ndash;1704), whose epistemology tended towards &representationalism; rather than &realism;, leading eventually to the &skepticism; of David Hume (1711&ndash;1776). By empiricism is sometimes meant more narrowly a focus on scientific experiment; however, a more appropriate term for that view is &scientism; or &experimentalism;.</def>
