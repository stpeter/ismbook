<term id='descriptivism' name='descriptivism'>
  <source>From English descriptive: represented in words by reference to actual qualities; derived from Latin describere: to copy off or transcribe.</source>
  <def topic='ethics'>The view that ethics merely represents or describes how human beings act in real life and that ethics cannot prescribe normative human values. English philosopher David Hume (1711&#8211;1776) and Italian political theorist Niccolo Machiavelli (1469&#8211;1527) are often characterized as descriptivists. The opposing view is &prescriptivism;.</def>
