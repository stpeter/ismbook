  <source>From Arabic islam: submission.</source>
  <def topic='religion'>A unified religious-political doctrine that advocates a strict &monotheism;, where the only recognized authority regarding the word of the one God was the Arabian prophet and warrior Mohammed (570-632) as laid down in the Koran. In metaphysics and ethics, it is a form of &fatalism; since it insists upon absolute submission to the arbitrary will of Allah; in ethics and politics, it is a form of &authoritarianism; since it insists upon absolute submission to the edicts of Mohammed and his successors or earthly representatives. The content of Islam is actively and often violently opposed to &rationalism;, &liberalism;, &capitalism;, &feminism;, &atheism;, and all competing religions (from &animism; to &zoroastrianism;).</def>
