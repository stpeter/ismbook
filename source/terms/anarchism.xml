<term id='anarchism' name='anarchism'>
  <source>A privative term derived from Greek archos: leader or ruler.</source>
  <def topic='politics'>Anarchism is inspired by the moral-political ideal of a society untouched by relations of power and domination among human beings. This ideal has most often expressed itself in a doctrine advocating the total absence of government as the only firm basis for individual liberty and societal progress - a doctrine that some argue animates even &marxism; (since Marx believed that eventually the state would wither away). Anarchism differs from political &libertarianism; in advocating a lack of government rather than limited government. There are several variants of anarchism, usually categorized by whether the variant is collectivistic (e.g., anarcho-syndicalism) or individualistic (e.g., anarcho-capitalism) in orientation. In popular usage, the term is often colored by the sometimes-violent anarchist political movement that was especially active in the years around 1900.</def>
