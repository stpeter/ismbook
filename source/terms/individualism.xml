<term id='individualism' name='individualism'>
  <source>From Latin individuus: indivisible, inseparable.</source>
  <def topic='ethics'>Any theory holding that the individual, not any sort of collective entity, is the proper beneficiary of action; thus individualism is essentially the same as &egoism; and is opposed to &altruism; or ethical &collectivism;. Most kinds of ethical individualism are forms of &eudaimonism;, but for instance this is not true of &existentialism;.</def>
  <def topic='epistemology'>The idea that only individual minds (not groups) can come to have knowledge.</def>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>The view that only particular, individual things exist; another word for &concretism; or &particularism;.</def>
  <def topic='politics'>Respect for individual rights, in opposition to various forms of &collectivism;; often synonymous with &libertarianism; or classical &liberalism;.</def>
