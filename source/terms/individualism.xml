<term id='individualism' name='individualism'>
  <source>From Latin individuus: indivisible, inseperable.</source>
  <def topic='ethics'>Any theory holding that the individual, not any sort of collective entity, is the proper beneficiary of action; thus individualism is essentially the same as &egoism; and is opposed to &altruism; or ethical &collectivism;. Most kinds of ethical individualism are forms of &eudaimonism;, but this is not true of, for example, &existentialism; or &stoicism;.</def>
  <def topic='epistemology'>The view that only individual minds (not groups) can come to have knowledge.</def>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>The view that only particular, individual things exist; another word for &concretism; or &particularism;.</def>
  <def topic='politics'>Respect for individual rights; often synonymous with &libertarianism; or classical &liberalism;.</def>
