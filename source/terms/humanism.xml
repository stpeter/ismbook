<term id='humanism' name='humanism'>
  <source>From Latin humanus: relating to or characteristic of human beings.</source>
  <def topic='ethics'>A focus on human concerns as opposed to the interests of the gods (&theism;) or the technical issues of philosophy (&logicism;). Examples include &aristotelianism; and &epicureanism; in ancient Greece, &confucianism; and &taoism; in China, Renaissance humanism in Europe, and some forms of &transcendentalism; and &pragmatism; in America. Although humanism is often closely associated with &secularism; and &individualism;, these connections are not necessary; in fact, humanism is sometimes thought of as a 'religion of humanity' that takes &altruism; and action for the sake of all humanity as its guiding principle (as in the &positivism; of August Comte).</def>
