<term id='conceptualism' name='conceptualism'>
  <source>From Latin conceptum: something conceived, an idea.</source>
  <def topic='epistemology'>The view that conceptual knowledge consists of non-arbitrary abstractions from perceptual knowledge, but that concepts do not have an independent existence. Conceptualism thus opposes both &nominalism; and &realism;. Although the main conceptualist in philosophical history was Peter Abailard (1079-1142), &aristotelianism; is also sometimes considered to be a form of conceptualism.</def>
