<term id='conceptualism' name='conceptualism'>
  <source>From Latin conceptum: something conceived, an idea.</source>
  <def topic='epistemology'>The view that conceptual knowledge consists of non-arbitrary abstractions from perceptual knowledge, but that concepts do not have an independent existence. Conceptualism thus opposes both &nominalism; and &realism;. The main conceptualist in philosophical history is Peter Abailard (1079-1142). However, it can be argued that various forms of &aristotelianism; are also conceptualist, although that is a topic of disagreement among scholars of Aristotle.</def>
