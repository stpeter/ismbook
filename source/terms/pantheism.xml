  <source>From Greek pan: all and Greek theos: god.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>The belief that God is the universe and the universe is God - or, more generally, that the universe is divine. While this idea often exists in a "primitive" form (usually called &animism;), it has also been expanded upon philosophically, for example by Spinoza (1632-1677) and in some strains of &hinduism; and &buddhism;.</def>
