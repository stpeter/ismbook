  <source>From Greek agnostos: unknowing, unknown, unknowable.</source>
  <def topic='epistemology'>The idea that one cannot know whether or not gods exist. Agnosticism adopts a "wait-and-see" attitude toward the existence of gods (similar in this regard to &skepticism;) and therefore is different from &atheism;, which positively asserts that gods do not exist.</def>
