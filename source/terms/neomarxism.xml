  <def topic='ethics'>A loose movement of late-20th-century political and social theorists who emphasized the &humanism; and &idealism; of Marx's early works (written before he formulated his theories of &dialecticalmaterialism; and economic &determinism;). The neo-Marxists emphasized psychological liberation instead of political revolution and thus were closer to some strains of &anarchism; than to state &socialism; or &communism;.</def>
