<term id='deism' name='deism'>
  <source>From Latin deus: god.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>The idea, especially popular during the Enlightenment of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, that God created the universe but then left it alone to operate on its own principles -- principles that human reason and scientific inquiry can discover. According to deism, God is not involved in the day-to-day workings of the universe and there are no miracles. Contrast with &theism;, &pantheism;, etc.</def>
