<term id='realism' name='realism'>
  <source>From Latin realis: relating to things.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>The notion that concepts or ideas exist in a separate realm of reality (most famous from the Theory of Forms in &platonism;); in this sense, metaphysical realism is nearly synonymous with metaphysical &idealism; and is usually contrasted with &nominalism;.</def>
  <def topic='epistemology'>The idea that concepts have actual referents in reality and therefore that human beings can and do possess reliable knowledge, both perceptual and conceptual, about reality (essentially a kind of &optimism; about the possibility of knowledge). In the psychology and philosophy of perception, realism comes in two flavors: direct realism is the principle that human beings perceive the actually existing physical world, whereas indirect realism is another term for &representationalism;.</def>
  <def topic='aesthetics'>With regard to the visual arts, realism is the portrayal of scenes, objects, and people in ways that are immediately intelligible to the viewer; this is often called &representationalism; and is usually contrasted with &abstractionism;. With regard to literature, realism is a focus on the often-gritty reality of life as it is, without the idealization inherent in &romanticism;; this usage is sometimes also applied in the visual arts.</def>
