<term id='epiphenomenalism' name='epiphenomenalism'>
  <source>From Greek epiphenomenon: something that appears in addition, a secondary symptom.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>The doctrine that consciousness is merely a secondary symptom of the underlying processes of the physical brain. An analogy is that consciousness is like a panel of multi-colored lights on a science-fiction computer: it's attractive, but it does not affect the operation of the machine. Unlike some radical forms of &behaviorism;, epiphenomenalism does not deny the subjective experience of consciousness, although it does deny that consciousness has causal efficacy.</def>
