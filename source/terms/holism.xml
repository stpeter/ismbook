<term id='holism' name='holism'>
  <source>From Greek holos: whole, complete, entire.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>The idea that all things in the universe are inseparably connected. Holism is opposed to &dualism; but respects &particularism; and therefore is also generally opposed to &monism; (interconnection does not imply unity). The term is sometimes used to refer to absolute &collectivism;, but this usage is uncommon.</def>
