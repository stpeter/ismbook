<term id='holism' name='holism'>
  <source>From Greek holos: whole, complete, entire.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>The idea that all things and events in the universe are inseparably connected. Holism is opposed to &dualism; but respects &particularism; and therefore is also generally opposed to &monism; because interconnection does not imply unity. The basic principle of holism is sometimes also applied to more particular topics, such as the view (opposed to &dualism;) that human beings are a seamless combination of mind and body.</def>
