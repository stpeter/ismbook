  <source>From Greek holos: whole, complete, entire.</source>
  <def topic='metaphysics'>The idea that all things and events in the universe are inseparably connected. Holism is opposed to &dualism; but respects &particularism; and therefore is also generally opposed to &monism; because interconnection does not imply unity.</def>
