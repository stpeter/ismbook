<term id='utilitarianism' name='utilitarianism'>
  <source>From English utility: usefulness.</source>
  <def topic='ethics'>A form of &consequentialism;, initiated by Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) and peaking with John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), that advocated the principle of "the greatest good for the greatest number" in ethics and society. Utilitarianism was usually a form of &altruism;, although Mill advocated a kind of &individualism; since he thought that the best way for humanity to make progress was through the achievements of individuals. Utilitarianism has never made a deep impression in American philosophy, where consequentialism has generally taken the form of &pragmatism;.</def>
