<h2>Pyrrhonism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[From the name of the Greek philosopher Pyrrho (c. 360-270 BCE).]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(epistemology) Pyrrho was a painter and poet who accompanied Alexander the Great on his Asian campaign and apparently underwent a philosophical conversion in Gandhara on the northwestern fringes of India, fueling speculation that he was influenced by early <a href="buddhism.html">Buddhism</a>. He believed that tranquility could be achieved only by steadfastly withholding judgment about ethical matters because they cannot be reliably decided as good or evil, true or false.</p></li></ol>
