Marxism inherited its dialectical understanding of history from <a href="hegelianism.html">Hegelianism</a>, but opposed Hegel's <a href="idealism.html">idealism</a> with a supposedly-scientific <a href="dialecticalmaterialism.html">dialectical materialism</a>. Although many Marxists claim that in theory their philosophy is a form of <a href="humanism.html">humanism</a>, in practice Marxist political systems such as Leninism and Maoism have proved to be forms of <a href="collectivism.html">collectivism</a> and therefore quite the opposite of humanism. (To be fair, in reaction to some of his early followers Marx said that he was not a Marxist.)</p></li></ol>
