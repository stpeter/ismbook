<h2>Zoroastrianism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[From the name of the Persian sage Zarathustra (6th or 7th century BCE).]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(religion) Perhaps the first example of <a href="monotheism.html">monotheism</a> among the religions of the world, Zoroastrianism held that there is a neverending struggle between good or truth and evil or deceit (a kind of <a href="dualism.html">dualism</a> that influenced both <a href="gnosticism.html">gnosticism</a> and <a href="manicheism.html">Manicheism</a>), that human beings have free will to choose between good and evil, and that individuals are subject to a final judgment assigning them to eternal salvation or damnation. Scholars speculate that the monotheism and messianism of Zoroastrianism had an influence on Middle Eastern religions such as <a href="judaism.html">Judaism</a>, <a href="christianity.html">Christianity</a>, and <a href="islam.html">Islam</a>, that early <a href="buddhism.html">Buddhism</a> was a reaction against the dogmatic ethical and religious certainties of Zarathustra, and that the very word philosophy is derived from Mazdayasna or "worship of wisdom" (the Avestan name for Zoroastrianism).</p></li></ol>
