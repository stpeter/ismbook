<h2>communism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[From Latin communis: shared by all.]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(politics) The political theory that an individual's actions should benefit the community or the state rather than the individual. It is the most radical kind of political <a href="collectivism.html">collectivism</a>, and depends on an equally radical <a href="altruism.html">altruism</a> in ethics. In practice, communism has always been a form of <a href="totalitarianism.html">totalitarianism</a>. When referring to actual political systems, communism is sometimes called Marxism-Leninism because of communism's link with the revolutionary doctrines of <a href="marxism.html">Marxism</a> and with countries inspired by the example of Lenin's revolution in Russia (and Mao's revolution in China). Communism is sometimes also called international <a href="socialism.html">socialism</a> in contrast to the national socialism of <a href="fascism.html">fascism</a>.</p></li></ol>
