<h2>altruism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[Coined by Auguste Comte (1798-1857) from French autrui, descended from Latin alter: other.]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(ethics) Regard for the welfare of other people (as opposed to one's own welfare) as the highest principle of action. While one could, in theory, describe altruism as a form of <a href="eudaimonism.html">eudaimonism</a> since it seeks to maximize happiness, eudaimonism is always taken to be a kind of <a href="individualism.html">individualism</a> or <a href="egoism.html">egoism</a> (and therefore in opposition to altruism). Strictly speaking, <a href="kantianism.html">Kantianism</a> and other forms of <a href="deontologism.html">deontologism</a> are not variants of altruism since they emphasize conformance with duty or moral law rather than concern for other people. In general, altruism emphasizes either the intent to benefit others (see <a href="intentionalism.html">intentionalism</a>) or the practical result that one's actions do indeed benefit others (see <a href="consequentialism.html">consequentialism</a>). Often altruistic doctrines are forms of <a href="universalism.html">universalism</a>, as in <a href="utilitarianism.html">utilitarianism</a> (which holds that the highest ethical principle is "the greatest good for the greatest number"). The popular meaning of altruism is loosely connected to the philosophical meaning, and usually refers to an attitude of benevolence toward other people.</p></li></ol>
