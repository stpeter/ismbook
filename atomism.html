<h2>atomism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[From Greek atomos: indivisible.]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(metaphysics) Any metaphysical or cosmological idea that reality is fundamentally made up only of extremely small, indivisible particles. This view was widespread among ancient Greek philosophers such as Democritus (460?-362? BCE) and Epicurus (341-271 BCE), and was revived in the 17th century by philosophers such as the Pierre Gassendi and scientists such as Robert Boyle, the founder of modern chemistry.</p></li></ol>
