<h2>idealism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[From Greek idea: archetype, pattern, form, type.]</em></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(metaphysics) In the original, Platonic sense, a theory claiming that the primary reality consists of eternal, unchanging, non-physical archetypes, of which the particular entities perceived by the senses are imperfect copies. The most significant forms of idealism after <a href="platonism.html">Platonism</a> are the monadology of Leibniz (a kind of <a href="panpsychism.html">panpsychism</a>) and <a href="hegelianism.html">Hegelianism</a>. Although <a href="spiritualism.html">spiritualism</a> is similar to idealism, it usually refers more to religious, supernatural conceptions of reality than to philosophical theories. The opposite of metaphysical idealism is <a href="materialism.html">materialism</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>(epistemology) Any theory holding that valid human knowledge is a matter of mentally grasping non-physical archetypes rather than perceiving (or abstracting concepts from) physical entities. Theories opposed to epistemological idealism include <a href="empiricism.html">empiricism</a> and <a href="conceptualism.html">conceptualism</a>.</p></li>
