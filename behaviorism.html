<p><em>[From English behavior: the manner in which a person, animal, or thing acts, either characteristically or in particular circumstances.]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(psychology) The doctrine that only a person's or animal's externally observed ways of acting provide legitimate data for the study of psychology. As originally formulated by John D. Watson in 1913, behaviorism was a methodological principle defined in order to pursue scientific objectivity in psychology. However, the behaviorist movement - pushed forward by prominent psychologists such as B.F. Skinner (1904-1990) and influenced by scientific <a href="operationalism.html">operationalism</a> - soon came to dismiss any internal states, mental phenomena, or higher-order emergent properties of living beings. The result was a kind of <a href="reductionism.html">reductionism</a>, <a href="materialism.html">materialism</a>, or even <a href="automatism.html">automatism</a> applied to animal and human activity, which in its more radical forms did not even seek to reduce consciousness to stimulus-response interactions, but simply ignored mental phenomena altogether. Since the 1960s, behaviorism has been supplanted by psychological <a href="cognitivism.html">cognitivism</a> and more recently by evolutionary psychology and other trends.</p></li></ol>
