<h2>asceticism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[From Greek asketes: a hermit or monk; derived from askesis: practice, training, mode of life.]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(ethics) Originally, an ascetic was one who practiced the mode of life of a hermit or  monk, characterized by solitude, meditation, prayer, toil, fasting, and celibacy. Implicit in this lifestyle of self-discipline and self-denial is the idea that the pleasures of this world should be renounced in favor of a higher purpose such as intellectual discipline or mystical insight. Often asceticism is connected to either <a href="spiritualism.html">spiritualism</a> or <a href="rationalism.html">rationalism</a>.
