<h2>realism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[From Latin realis: relating to things.]</em></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(metaphysics) The notion that concepts or ideas exist in a separate realm of reality (most famous from the Theory of Forms in <a href="platonism.html">Platonism</a>); in this sense, metaphysical realism is nearly synonymous with metaphysical <a href="idealism.html">idealism</a> and is usually contrasted with <a href="nominalism.html">nominalism</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>(epistemology) The idea that concepts have actual referents in reality and therefore that human beings can and do possess reliable knowledge, both perceptual and conceptual, about reality (essentially a kind of <a href="optimism.html">optimism</a> about the possibility of knowledge). In the psychology and philosophy of perception, realism comes in two flavors: direct realism is the principle that human beings perceive the actually existing physical world, whereas indirect realism is another term for <a href="representationalism.html">representationalism</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>(aesthetics) With regard to the visual arts, realism is the portrayal of scenes, objects, and people in ways that are immediately intelligible to the viewer; this is often called <a href="representationalism.html">representationalism</a> and is usually contrasted with <a href="abstractionism.html">abstractionism</a>. With regard to literature, realism is a focus on the often-gritty reality of life as it is, without the idealization inherent in <a href="romanticism.html">romanticism</a>; this usage is sometimes also applied in the visual arts.</p></li>
