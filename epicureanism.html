Epicurus held that true pleasure consists in the absence of all bodily pains and mental disturbances, a condition he claimed could be easily achieved through moderation, friendship, and the pursuit of wisdom. While Epicureanism was more individualistic than the competing school of <a href="stoicism.html">Stoicism</a>, its view of happiness was less activist than that of <a href="aristotelianism.html">Aristotelianism</a> and can even be compared to some Eastern views like <a href="taoism.html">Taoism</a>. Epicurus founded his school in an Athenian garden in the generation after the death of Aristotle and it flourished throughout the Mediterranean for over 700 years.</p></li></ol>
