<h2>dynamism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[From Greek dunamis: power, force, energy.]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(metaphysics) The idea that the universe fundamentally consists of changeable forces or energies rather than stable entities. Dynamism is often augmented by the notion that much of the stability we perceive is illusory and that everything is constantly changing or in flux - sometimes called a Heraclitean view of the universe, after the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus (c. 535-475 BCE). The best-known dynamists of recent times were Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947) and Henri Bergson (1859-1941), who are often called "process philosophers" because they focused on dynamic processes.</p></li></ol>
