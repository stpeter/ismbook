<h2>Hegelianism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[From the name of the German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel (1770-1831).]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(system) The philosophical system of Hegel or the philosophical tradition that began with him. In metaphysics, Hegel advocated a kind of historically-minded absolute <a href="idealism.html">idealism</a>, in which the universe would realize its spiritual potential through the development of human society. Hegel's absolute idealism is often contrasted with the subjective or transcendental <a href="idealism.html">idealism</a> of <a href="kantianism.html">Kantianism</a>, on whose innovations - in addition to the metaphysical <a href="absolutism.html">absolutism</a> of Spinoza (1632-1677) - Hegel based much of his philosophy. In political theory, Hegel advocated an organic theory of the state positing that individuals are merely parts of the whole (a form of <a href="collectivism.html">collectivism</a> often also attributed to <a href="platonism.html">Platonism</a>). Hegel was probably the first philosopher to think of history as a dialectical process, which inspired the <a href="dialecticalmaterialism.html">dialectical materialism</a> of <a href="marxism.html">Marxism</a>.</p></li></ol>
