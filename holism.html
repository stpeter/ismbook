<h2>holism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[From Greek holos: whole, complete, entire.]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(metaphysics) The idea that all things and events in the universe are inseparably connected. Holism is opposed to <a href="dualism.html">dualism</a> but respects <a href="particularism.html">particularism</a> and therefore is also generally opposed to <a href="monism.html">monism</a> because interconnection does not imply unity. The basic principle of holism is sometimes also applied to more particular topics, such as the view (opposed to <a href="dualism.html">dualism</a>) that human beings are a seamless combination of mind and body.</p></li></ol>
