In general, Taoism as described in the Tao Te Ching and by Chuang Tzu (4th century BCE) was a reaction against the more conservative and action-oriented tradition of <a href="confucianism.html">Confucianism</a>; in addition, later forms of Taoism borrowed heavily from <a href="buddhism.html">Buddhism</a>.</p></li></ol>
