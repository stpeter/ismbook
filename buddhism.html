<h2>Buddhism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[From Sanskrit budh: to awaken or to know.]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(religion) In ancient India, a buddha was a person who had achieved deep or even divine enlightenment. The historical Buddha of Buddhist thought was Siddhartha Gautama (5th or 6th century BCE), who lived a life of detachment from worldly affairs, distrust of perceptual appearance and social conventions, inner-directed reflection and meditation, and suppression of pain, sorrow, and desire. Traditionally, Buddhism has stressed self-denial (similar to <a href="stoicism.html">Stoicism</a> but sometimes bordering on <a href="asceticism.html">asceticism</a>), the unity of all things (see <a href="holism.html">holism</a>), and a kind of spiritualized <a href="individualism.html">individualism</a>. Although many Buddhists consider Gautama to be divine, Buddhism is not a form of <a href="theism.html">theism</a> in the Western sense. Through the centuries, several major schools of Buddhist thought emerged (most prominently Mahayana and Theravada) and Buddhist ideas were combined with traditional Chinese beliefs like <a href="taoism.html">Taoism</a>, resulting in Ch'an (or Zen) Buddhism. In fact, Buddhism is quite similar to Taoism in many ways, although Buddhism is closer to <a href="transcendentalism.html">transcendentalism</a> since it puts a greater value on ultimate detachment and eternal enlightenment, a state known as nirvana. Early Buddhism probably also influenced ancient Greek <a href="skepticism.html">skepticism</a> since the founder of <a href="pyrrhonism.html">Pyrrhonism</a> was converted to philosophy in Gandhara on the northwestern fringes of India.</p></li></ol>
