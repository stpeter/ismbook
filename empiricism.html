<h2>empiricism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[From Greek empeirikos: relating to or derived from experience.]</em></p>
<ol><li><p>(epistemology) A theory of knowledge holding that experience is the most reliable source of knowledge. In general, empiricism emphasizes induction over deduction and reality over theory - as, for instance, in the essays of Francis Bacon (1561-1626). More specifically, the school of empiricism in the 17th and 18th centuries reacted against the excesses of medieval <a href="scholasticism.html">scholasticism</a> and <a href="rationalism.html">rationalism</a> by formulating a more systematic grounding for empirical knowledge. The founder of that school was John Locke (1632-1704), whose epistemology tended towards <a href="representationalism.html">representationalism</a> rather than <a href="realism.html">realism</a>, leading eventually to the <a href="skepticism.html">skepticism</a> of David Hume (1711-1776). By empiricism is sometimes meant more narrowly a focus on scientific experiment; however, a more appropriate term for that view is <a href="scientism.html">scientism</a> or <a href="experimentalism.html">experimentalism</a>.</p></li></ol>
